## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in significant loss of life. This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the demographics of the passengers and their survival outcomes.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this analysis contains various attributes of Titanic passengers, including their age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is available in the file `titanic.csv`.

## Data Analysis

### Data Exploration

- Basic statistics of the dataset.
- Identifying missing values.
- Exploring the distribution of passenger classes, ages, and more.

### Data Visualization

Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, visualizations are created to better understand the data. Some example visualizations include:

- A bar chart showing the survival rate by passenger class.
- A histogram of passenger ages.
- A pie chart illustrating the gender distribution on the Titanic.

## Logistic Regression Model

A logistic regression model is built to predict the survival of passengers based on the provided attributes. The model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated for accuracy.

## Conclusion

This Titanic dataset analysis provides valuable insights into the demographics and survival outcomes of passengers on the ill-fated voyage. The combination of data exploration, visualization, and a logistic regression model helps us understand the factors that influenced survival rates.
